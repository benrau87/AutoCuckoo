[tor]

# Please note that in order to implement this functionality securely
# without any additional privilege on the part of Cuckoo, the below
# scripts should simply pass the IP address of the VM used for analysis 
# to a daemon running as root, which can run the
# iptables rules itself. For a working example, see
# https://github.com/seanthegeek/routetor

# Specify the path to a binary or script that will initiate the firewall
# rules to redirect traffic to the Tor transparent proxy.  The file
# will be executed with the argument of the static IP of the VM used
# for analysis.
